R

Step	|Clause	|Derivation	
------------------------------
 1.	| Rv~P	| Given.	
 2.	| Rv~Q	| Given.	
 3.	| ~RvP	| Given.	
 4.	| ~RvQ	| Given.	
 5.	| ~R	| Negated conclusion.	
 6.	| 	| Resolved Rv~P and ~RvP to Rv~R, which is in turn null.                                 
A contradiction is found when ~R is assumed as true. Hence, R is true.
